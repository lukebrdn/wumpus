# Wumpus

Wumpus is a game written in Javascript and based on the game Hunt the Wumpus, by Gregory Yop. 

# Gameplay

In its current state, the gameplay is very basic. A player can move an image of the actor, Mr. T, around a board of rooms using the arrow keys on their keyboard. 

# Future improvements

- Add a hidden sword necessary to kill the wumpus

# Why I make this? 

I built this as an exercise to improve my Javascript skills. My friend and coffeeschool professor, @jackolantern, gave me the idea to attempt this and has graciously offerred feedback and help during the process.
