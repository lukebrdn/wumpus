# Wumpus

Wumpus is a game written in Javascript and based on the game Hunt the Wumpus, by Gregory Yop. 

# Gameplay

In its current state, the gameplay is very basic. A player can move an image of the actor, Mr. T, around a board of rooms using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The goal is to find the sword before falling into a pit or running into the wumpus. Once you have the sword you can kill the wumpus.

# Why did I make this? 

Because games are fun. Also, I built this as an exercise to improve my Javascript skills. My friend and coffeeschool professor, @jackolantern, gave me the idea to attempt this and has graciously offerred feedback and help during the process.
