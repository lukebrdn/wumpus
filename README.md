# Wumpus

Wumpus is a game written in Javascript. It's based on a game written by Gregory Yop, Hunt the Wumpus. 

# Gameplay

In its current state, the gameplay is very basic. A player can move an image of the actor, Mr. T, around a board of rooms using the arrow keys on their keyboard. 

# Future improvements

- Improve the interface
- Add messaging, so player knows if it is close to the wumpus or pits
- Add a hidden sword necessary to kill the wumpus
- Add a way to measure life (deep, I know)

# Why I make this? 

I built this as an exercise to improve my Javascript skills. My friend and coffeeschool professor, @jackolantern, gave me the idea to attempt this and has graciously offerred feedback and help during the process.
